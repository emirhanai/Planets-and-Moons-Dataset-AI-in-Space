## Dataset
The Planets and Moons dataset consists of approximately 8 confirmed planets, 2 dwarf planets, and 1 Earth's moon, the Moon. It includes 11 classes in total.

There are 149 photos of each planet in 3D. All photos are optimized and ready for convolution for AI applications.

Annotations are licensed by Emirhan BULUT under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license. This software and dataset cannot be used for commercial purposes without permission.

Images are listed as licensed CC BY-NC 4.0. The dataset was collected by Emirhan BULUT. The dataset was compiled and collected in accordance with the sensitivity parameters.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Software in Space
The software has been prepared with a 100% accuracy, 0.0025 Loss result, superior to most ready-made models.
